# Students' dropout and academic success prediction

## Dataset Information 

This dataset includes several attributes about social-economic factors and academic performance information, as well as demographic, socioeconomic and macroeconomic data. This information is going to be used to analyze possible predictors of student’s dropout and academic success of undergraduate degrees offered at a higher education institution. In addition to that, the current dataset is useful for conducting comparative studies on student academic performance and also for training in the machine learning area.This analysis has the objective of providing valuable insights regarding the motivations of the students to stay in school or abandon their studies to focus in other areas. 

The data sources used consist of internal and external data from the institution and include data from:

1. Academic Management System (AMS) of the institution. 
2. Support System for the Teaching Activity of the institution.
3. Annual data from the General Directorate of Higher Education (DGES) regarding admission through the National Competition for Access to Higher Education (CNAES).
4. Contemporary Portugal Database (PORDATA) regarding macroeconomic data.

The data refer to records of students enrolled between the academic years 2008/2009 to 2018/2019. These include data from 17 undergraduate degrees from different fields of knowledge, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The final dataset is available as a comma-separated values (CSV) file encoded as UTF8 and consists of 4424 records.

The categories are listed below:
