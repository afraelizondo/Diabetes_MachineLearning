# Students' dropout and academic success prediction


## Overview of the project 

Every year, a large number of students dropout of school worldwide. This involves economic and social factors of a country. Education failure represents an obstacle to economic growth, employment, competitiveness, and productivity, directly impacting the lives of students and their families, higher education institutions, and society as a whole. 

We decided to choose this dataset because it represents an interesting topic among the population, due to the fact that academic success is a factor for jobs, social justice, and economic growth. 

On the other hand, dropout represents one of the most problematic issues that higher education institutions must address to improve their success. According to Oxford Languages, a dropout as a noun, is defined as a person who has abandoned a course of study or who has rejected conventional society to pursue an alternative lifestyle.

The proportion of students who dropout varies between different studies depending on the calculation methods and data sources.  

With the help of different visualizations and machine learning, we will be able to predict the percentage of students' dropout and academic success. In this way, decisions related to this are gonna be made with a solid foundation. 



## Dataset Information 

This dataset includes several attributes about social-economic factors and academic performance information, as well as demographic, socioeconomic and macroeconomic data. This information is going to be used to analyze possible predictors of student’s dropout and academic success of undergraduate degrees offered at a higher education institution. In addition to that, the current dataset is useful for conducting comparative studies on student academic performance and also for training in the machine learning area.This analysis has the objective of providing valuable insights regarding the motivations of the students to stay in school or abandon their studies to focus in other areas. 

The data sources used consist of internal and external data from the institution and include data from:

1. Academic Management System (AMS) of the institution. 
2. Support System for the Teaching Activity of the institution.
3. Annual data from the General Directorate of Higher Education (DGES) regarding admission through the National Competition for Access to Higher Education (CNAES).
4. Contemporary Portugal Database (PORDATA) regarding macroeconomic data.

The data refer to records of students enrolled between the academic years 2008/2009 to 2018/2019. These include data from 17 undergraduate degrees from different fields of knowledge, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The final dataset is available as a comma-separated values (CSV) file encoded as UTF8 and consists of roughly 3600 records.

The categories are listed below:

Table 1 

- Mother’s qualification; The qualification of the student's mother.
- Father’s qualification; The qualification of the student's father.
- Mother’s occupation; The occupation of the student's mother.
- Father’s occupation; The occupation of the student's father.
- Gender; The gender of the student. 
- Daytime/evening attendance; Whether the student attends classes during the day or in the evening.
- Target (Output).

Table 2 

- Marital status; The marital status of the student.
- Nationality; The nationality of the student. 
- Application Mode; The method of application used by the student. 
- Course; The course taken by the student.

## Questions to answer with this dataset


1. Which are the highest risk factors for dropout?
2. Which factors are linked with student completion?
3. How do different features interact with each other?
4. Which are the existing gaps in accessibility across different student populations?

By answering these questions, research insight is generated which will provide critical information for the formulation of strategies that promote successful degree completion among students from different backgrounds; by understanding students' academic progress and identify areas of improvement from both an individual and institutional perspective.
